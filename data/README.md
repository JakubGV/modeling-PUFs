# Data

## Description
This folder houses the challenge-responses pairs (CRPs) used to conduct the modeling attacks on the different types of arbiter PUFs. The [challenge set](./APUF_XOR_Challenge_Parity_64_500000.csv) and the different responses are all housed here. The CRPs are not generated by me but are instead generated and made public in *Deep learning based model building attacks on arbiter PUF compositions*.
